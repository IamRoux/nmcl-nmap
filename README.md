# NMCL - Nmap
Part of the NMCL (No More Command Line) project. This repo specifically applies to the tool nmap.



## FAQ

#### Why?
This project was mainly just to improve my programming skills.
However I do believe GUI-izing cli tools can be beneficial to those
who are not tech-savy or people with sight problems.


#### How do I change Themes?
You can change themes by editing:
```python
ps.theme('DarkBlue')
```
Refer to PySimpleGUI Docs for a list of themes.

## Installation

Clone repository with git

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IamRoux/nmcl-nmap.git
  cd nmcl-nmap
  poetry install
  python3 nmcl-nmap.py
```
Poetry isn't really needed, the dependencies can be installed manually if wanted. 
I just personally like Poetry.
